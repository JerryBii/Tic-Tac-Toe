# Tic-Tac-Toe
Pass-and-play Tic-Tac-Toe game created using Pygame.
Simple program made purely with functions, no objects here sadly :(
Co-workers and I used to use it to pass the time during my first co-op term.

Used this project to dip my toes into Pygame and was quite happy with the result!
Though it may not be the cleanest and lacks a lot of proper etiquette it is functional

To run the program please make sure to install
###numpy
and
###pygame

ex.
###pip install ...
